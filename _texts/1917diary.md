## July 8, 1917 -- Sunday 

Last night {{ "Roy Needham" | lod_link: "" }} and {{ "I" | lod_link: "Robert C. Binkley" }} went down to a dinner invitation at {{ "Wolff" | lod_link: "" }}'s place. I thought the old man had said 18 no 1st St, but it was {{ "18 N. 13th st." | lod_link: "Wolff's place" }} So we went far, far down to 1st St and looked among the coal chutes for some sign of the place. But it was all factory and coal and railroad. Then we called up {{ "the pastor" | lod_link: "" }} and got the right address from him. We found the place easily after waiting an age for the cars. But when we got there we found that the old man had really meant that we should come at 7:00 and enjoy an evening with some girls. So they took us down town to dinner, and then we walked slowly home so as to be sure to be late enough. 

One of the girls they had there was a demure little church girl who didn't open her mouth during the evening, but the other was a wonder. Her name was {{ "Ritz" | lod_link: "Miss Ritz" }}, or something like that, and she was the most wonderful talker I ever heard. She talked just like a New York shop girl -- I mean that was her vocabulary -- but she certainly had an interesting way of telling things. She was as wise as a serpent, too, and talked about things as if she had spent twenty years in seeing the world. She danced the hula hula and sang doubtful songs. She was a wonder. I let {{ "Roy" | lod_link: "Roy Needham" }} take her home. I couldn't have done otherwise, in fact. 

{{ "Our" | lod_link: "USAAS" }} sections are going to be increased to 45. Then we will be given 16 Fords and have 32 drivers. As soon as we get our equipment we are going to go on a  hike. Then, when all the sections have come back from practise hikes we will take our full motor equipment and go out on a "ride", with field kitchen and everything -- each battallion by itself. Soon after that we expect to go over. The boys are betting even money that we go before Aug 1st. I hope so. {{ "Allentown" | lod_link: "" }} does not appeal to me very much as a place of permanent residence. 

A Sunday or two ago when I went to {{ "church" | lod_link: "" }} I was very naughty. I sat down behind a very good little boy with a stiff boy-collar, such as I would hate to wear. He was about 4 years old, and he had a very devout grandfather at hand to keep him in order. Every time the little boy wiggled the devout grandfather would nudge him. An evil thought struck me. I would see if I could not make that little boy be bad. 

I stuck the back of his neck with a pencil, but he never flinched. I blew at him through a tube made of a church program. He remained good. I tickled the back of his neck, but with untouched virtue he merely tossed his head a little. I had just about decided that he was incorruptible, when, during a half hour prayer, he turned around and looked at me. Then it was that he was lost. I stuck out my tongue at him, ever so little. He returned the favor. Then he began to be bad. You never saw a little boy so bad. He got down on hands and knees on the bench. He turned around repeatedly. Meanwhile the devout grandfather, compelled to remain motionless during prayer, could only nudge the boy with half hearted, sneaky, pokes as if he was trying to nudge without having God see him at it. When the prayer was ended the boy, now totally depraved, continued to wiggle most licentiously, and crawl around in a thoroughly sinful manner. 

The devout grandfather was in despair. He nudged desperately; then, as he saw that the nudges had no effect, he became intently interested in the sermon and tried to ignore the scandalous behavior of the degenerate youngster. 

During a song I got an opportunity I had been waiting for. The boy was leaning over the back of the seat, not far from my face. I leaned forward. 

"Little boy, do you know who I am?" 

"No --" 

"I am the devil! I am Satan! Come with me  and play! I will give you some candy!" 

You should have seen his eyes open. Then, to reinforce the point I had made, I made a horrible face at him. He turned around instntly and remained as good and still as an angel during the restof the service. 

But I realy think it is a crime to bring such little children to church. Christ would have let them play outside till he was through with the sermon and the reading and the communion, and then he would have gone out and played with them. Or else he would have let them wiggle all they wished in church. 

And while I am talking about church etc. I must tell how I became acquainted with a very nice girl and won an invitation to dinner and got the dinner. 

The {{ "League" | lod_link: "Epworth League" }} had a party or social or reception on Thursday night, but I was in {{ "Marietta" | lod_link: "" }} then, so of course I didn't go. But I learned from the boys that there had been a big crowd and that all the available boys had been taken up in no time. 

A Minnesota man, {{ "Farley" | lod_link: "" }}, a Pasadena man and a Hamlin man had made an agreement that whoever didn't get a girl in church would treat the rest to an ice cream soda. I was at a disadvantage, because I had not been at the social. 

But I went into the church early, and instead of going down with the rest of the boys in the "reserved section" I stayed in back of the church and looked over the situation I saw a girl with a vacant seat nearby. It was crowded enough in that neighborhood to make it a very natural thing, so I took that seat. She wiggled her foot a little, and I asked her if she had a church program, she said no, and asked if I had a Sunday School Advocate and gave me hers. Then I made my coup. "Weren't you at the social last Thursday?" "Yes -- I thought I saw you there --" And of course she thought we had been introduced there. It was a good dinner I got there, too. 

## July 9, 1917 -- Monday. 

It was raining hard this morning when we got up, so we had setting up exercises at our bunks -- just then the sergeant yelled Fall in, so here goes another entry. 

## July 11, 1917 

It has been raining steadily for three days now -- the weather is exactly like a California winter. Some of the boys have gone out in the country with nothing but shelter tents. I am glad I am not one of that bunch. 

On Monday night Elmer and I went down to a dinner at Rhues. We met some very nice girls there, and sang songs and played Flinch just as they do in Palo Alto. We were almost late to camp. The girls are going to fix up a picnic for Saturday afternoon. I hope this old rain stops so we can enjoy it. 

{{ "Mrs. Rhue" | lod_link: "" }} has charge of the service in the {{ "jail" | lod_link: "Lehigh County Jail" }} next Sunday. She asked me to speak there. I guess my little speeches in League must have made a hit. I don't know exactly what I will say, but I am going to try to make the service a good one. There are about 200 prisoners there. 

We have our uniforms at last. I was only moderately fortunate in fit and match. My pants were so small that I couldn't get them on, so I traded with skinney {{ "Robert Dingley" | lod_link: "" }}. They fitted well, but they do not match his coat at all, and he has been trying to trade with someone else. My slicker is entirely too long. It comes down to my heels and impedes my walking. But I am going to try to exchange it for the next smaller size. I had a lot of trouble with leggins. They had only two sizes -- no 2 and no 5. I couldn't get into a no 2, and the no 5 was so large that I could have poured a gallon of plaster paris around my leg. It was just like standing in a barrel. But I went back, and by means of some high power talking secured a chance to look over the pile. At last I found a pair of no. 4s which had been left there by somebody who had exchanged them for others. They fit me pretty well. 

Poor {{ "Roy Needham" | lod_link: "" }} had wretched luck. He claims that the only thing that fit him was his hat cord and belt. But he went in and exchanged till he was pretty well fitted out. 

I was unable to get a hat large enough for me, but I don't care. I am going to go down and get the largest they have and let it stretch. 

{{ "Otto Lachmund" | lod_link: "" }} has been trying to bulldoze me into trading trousers with him, -- He says I look like a sprouted onion or a fig in them [sketch of man in uniform with a large bottom] you get the idea. But I don't care if they do stick out pretty far because it makes them more comfortable. 

I pity the poor fellows who have no slickers during weather like this. Most of them take a complete newspaper and make a hold in it to fit the head. Then they always go at double time, and never halt until they get under shelter. [sketch] It looks funny to see a whole section go running to mess equipped in that way. 

Sometimes they will take a shelter tent or a shiker[?] or a piece of canvas, and gather together in bunches of a dozen or more, holding the canvas over them as they march in little knots of men. It makes me think a little of the Roman turtle back formation. 

We have very little to do during the rain. There is no drill, and few lectures. I took my injection of typhoid serum yesterday, but that is about all I did all day. 

I have not gotten any letters for 4 days, but I still have three or four to answer. I sent the part of my diary that tells about my vacation with the folks. 

I am going to paste the alternate pages of my diary with pictures etc. It will give me something to do when I don't feel like working. 

By the way, folks, I wish one of you would keep some such record as this. I guess {{ "Charles" | lod_link: "Charles H. Binkley" }} is doing it, judging from the letters I get from him. If I am able to do it I am going to get a stronger camera to take over with me. In that case I will send this one home, and you can use it there to illustrate your record once in a while. 

## July 11th 1917 

The rain has been bothering us all week, the parade ground and the whole {{ "camp" | lod_link: "Camp Crane" }} is gooey and slushy but I think everything clears up today. That will mean we will start drilling again for drill has been impossible lately. 

{{ "Aunt Violetta" | lod_link: "Violetta Barr Engle" }} sent me a nice big box with peanuts and cake and fried chicken in it. It was tremendously good. Here in our section when a man gets a box of eats he distributes it, but we have observed that in the {{ "Columbia" | lod_link: "Columbia University" }} section across the way he goes off into a corner and enjoys it himself. On the fourth of July, while I was in Marietta the {{ "Stanford" | lod_link: "Stanford University" }} and {{ "Hamlin" | lod_link: "Hamline University" }} units pretty nearly had a fight with Columbia. A Columbia man accused one of our fellows of fouling camp. Our bunch resented it. The Columbia boys sat in front of their quarters and threw firecrackers across the company street at our boys and the Hamlin crowd, who sitting outside the barracks. Stanford and Hamlin replied with a shower of pebbles and invectives. The Columbia boys discussed the ancestry and morality of Stanford with great vigor and profanity. Our boys were preparing to rush over when the Corporal of the Guard arrived. But long after Taps that night someone exploded a fire cracker in the middle of our barracks. A few of our fellows ran down to Columbia, but every Columbia man was fast asleep. 

## July 13th 1917 

{{ "Bill Adams" | lod_link: "William Adams" }} and I have made a letter & agreement. He knows a lot of fellows who write to me and I know a good many who write to him. After censoring mail from these parties -- {{ "Mervyn" | lod_link: "Mervyn Crobaugh" }}, {{ "Art" | lod_link: "Art Cardin" }}, {{ "Johnnie Brokenshire" | lod_link: "John Brokenshire" }}, -- {{ "Dave Eliot" | lod_link: "" }}, {{ "Whittier Wellman" | lod_link: "" }} and so forth -- we will hand them over to each other. 

{{ "Fig Leaf" | lod_link: "Edward Leaf" }} and I went out this morning with two rolls of film and took 8 pictures of each other. That is going pretty far on modesty, isn't it? The fellows are all laughing at us. I am going to get some pictures taken down town one of these day -- some real good ones. 

We were paid the other day -- I got $15, but I owed $5 to the Post Exchange. As we were marching back to quarters from the office we met Sergeant {{ "Sammy Seward" | lod_link: "" }} running faster than I ever saw him run before. But he was too late, and came back panting. Pretty soon Fat Hoffman came trotting down the trail. We all had to laugh at him. 

We have gone out on two marches so far, one of two miles and one of three. It is great to get the bunch out at route step again, singing "Around her neck, she wore a yellow ribbon" "Son of a gamboleer" "Drink beer with me" and so forth. Then once in a while a fellow will start a Stanford song and we will make the fences shake. 

I noticed a quaint sign at the town limits. Instead of "Town Limits -- Automobiles slow down to 10 miles per hour" it said "Glück Auf -- Auf Wiedersehen." 

The other day during the rain we marched down in single file to the place where we usually have a lecture but no lecturer arrived. So we were ordered to "Fall in!" Some of the fellows wanted to run back to barracks without falling in. After we had marched through two or three wide mud puddles {{ "Otto Lachmund" | lod_link: "" }} and five others began to pick their way and broke ranks to keep out of the mud. 

When me got back to quarters {{ "Seward" | lod_link: "Sammy Seward" }} took them and marched them through all the mud he could find. {{ "Fat Hoffman" | lod_link: "" }} got a good picture of them too. 

Sergeant {{ "Seward" | lod_link: "Sammy Seward" }} is a wonder for getting in good with people. Some one out west wrote to him asking what the boys would like. He replied "Red Cross sweaters". He got a telegram "We are shipping 30 Red Cross sweaters. Mine is a well knit black one. A card sewed to the neck was from 

{{ "Helen Deamer" | lod_link: "" }}   
{{ "Los Altos -- Cal." | lod_link: "Los Altos, California" }}   

I wrote her a letter of thanks etc. 

At another time the women of Allentown gave the whole camp a lot of jam. {{ "Sammy Seward" | lod_link: "" }} -- who, it must be admitted, has a very distinguished appearance -- asked some of the ladies whom the boys might thank. 

They asked him what else the boys would like, and he suggested pies, and remarked that it might be a good idea to bake a pie apiece for one section to see whether the boys liked pies. -- {{ "Section 78" | lod_link: "SSU 578" }}, he added, would, in his opinion, be well fitted to judge. Result was that a message came up from headquarters a few days later to send an orderly down for some cakes. The orderly brought back 21 warm pies -- and they don't make pies in California as they make them back here. We put a guard of four huskies over them, sent a pie to Lieutenant {{ "Jones" | lod_link: "" }}, and prepared for a wonderfully big eating fest. It made us laugh to see the men from all around crowd around the little window in the clerk's office to look at the pies. They lined up three deep in front of there quarters and eyed us hungrily, when we began to eat, but they got nary a bite. We are generous among ourselves but stingy with any other sections. 

Yesterday we had a lecture on the articles of War. All the penalties have been increased threefold. The fellows who try to sneak through the fence -- and a lot of them do it -- are guilty of "forcing a safeguard" -- penalty is death or such other punishment as a court martial may direct. We found that it is an offense against military law to act as correspondent for any publication, that a noncom can arrest a commissioned officer -- and a lot of things that were news to me. 

{{ "Bill Adams" | lod_link: "William Adams" }} and I have been playing chess lately. He generally beats me pretty badly, but I have defeated him twice. He was one of the three Stanford men who defeated Prof. {{ "Gage" | lod_link: "Prof. Gage" }}, of {{ "San Francisco" | lod_link: "" }}, and won his games in the chess tournament with {{ "U.C." | lod_link: "University of California" }} He has a queen's opening that is a perfect wonder, but I am working out a good defense against it. 

We secured permission to bring in 9 more men from Stanford. I saw that Mervyn's name was put on the preferred list we sent to {{ "McDowell" | lod_link: "" }}, and I wired Mervyn to call up Registrar's office. He probably will not want to come, but I wanted to give him the opportunity of coming with me in this unit. I hope he comes, although I don't realy expect it. If he does come he will leave San Francisco today. 

{{ "Pete Lindsey" | lod_link: "" }} has come with the {{ "second California crowd" | lod_link: "SSU from UC" }}. I have had several visit with him. He seems to be very glad to see me. We have talked a whole lot about old {{ "Logeion" | lod_link: "Logeion Literary Society" }} -- when we get back to California I guess we will go down there to visit. 

The latest rumor says that we will not go to France for months. I don't like this waiting around, but now that the rain is over and the good hard drill has begun this life will be more active. 

## July 18th 1917 

I got an interesting letter from Art. He said he was looking through a pile of telegrams when he saw one addressed to {{ "Merv" | lod_link: "Mervyn Crobaugh" }}. When he came to he found the messenger boys fanning him. He called up Crobaughs and found that Merv had gone to {{ "the city" | lod_link: "San Francisco" }} to enlist. But it is 7 days since I telegraphed, and no word from Crobaughs yet. The suspense is terrible. 

We went off for a short hike the other day. We turned off the main road and walked up a long, old fashioned lane. There were wild blackberries and raspberries on the fence -- which we picked. Wild grapes and poison ivy covered the fences. All kinds of pretty flowers grew in the grass. The corn in the field alongside was rank and high -- about 3 feet. From the meadow of timothy and clover we heard a bob white calling. At the end of the lake we crossed a slow and idle brook, which looked just right for swimming -- then we reached an old fashioned farm house and farm yard. The farm yard was full of pigs and children of an indeterminate age. We fell out and got water at a cistern -- the water tasted flat and sickly. We made friends with the children -- they were 6 to 10 years old -- One particularly interesting young lady was Miranda. A very bashful little boy was Sylvester. I was the only one who could make friends with Sylvester. 

Bill Adams has a friend ({{ "Johnson" | lod_link: "" }}) in {{ "South Bethlehem" | lod_link: "Bethlehem" }}. He had permission to bring a friend for dinner, so he brought me. It is about 50 minutes from camp by trolly. 

The house is a huge one, -- old colonial style. It is just a block from {{ "Schwab" | lod_link: "" }}'s {{ "residence" | lod_link: "Schwab's residence" }}. Mr. Johnson is one of the big engineers, at the top of the bridge department. He has a very mediocre wife and a perfect type of boarding school daughter, 15 years old. I had a fine meal and a pleasant evening, and got a good view of the one end of the {{ "Bethlehem Steel Works" | lod_link: "" }}. A heavy blanket of foggy smoke lies over the works, but the great chimneys stand out majestically above it. From some of the chimneys great tongues of flame leap into the air. It is a wierd scene to look upon just after dusk, when the city below is growing invisable, and the great chimney beyond and the big railway terminal in the foreground seem to dominate the city, and make the miles and miles of homes appear insignificant compared with them. I borrowed Mark Twain's Tom Sawyer to read again. 

I must tell you the sequel to that evening at Ruhe's. {{ "Grainger" | lod_link: "" }}, the Michigan man who was with us, found out that he could not get off till 5:00. {{ "Elmer Heald" | lod_link: "" }} got cold feet and didn't want to get off at all. But I was off duty from 10:A.M. So Grainger told me to go down and see the girls and try to get the picnic postponed till 5:00. I accordingly went down to Rhue's gave them the message from Grainger, and asked {{ "Leah Rhue" | lod_link: "" }} to sew my hat band on and tighten up my jacket buttons, all of which she did with great neatness and despatch. Then we went out on the porch -- I was introduced to {{ "Mary Robs" | lod_link: "" }} (or something like that) and crammed with cake, I expected an invite to dinner, but thought better of it before it came and left the place at 11:30 after a very successful call. But I had given myself a reputation as a cake eater that will stay with me as long as I am in Allentown. Just before I left I arranged to meet the girls outside the fair rounds gate at 2:00, and see the Fall of the Bastile day exercises together. 

Well, when I found out that Elmer Heald couldn't come, and Bill Adams was gone to Philadelphia, I took Fig Leaf to help me. I thought 4 girls would be enough or too much to handle alone. We stood at the gate for quite a long time, but no girls arrived, so we went down to the fair grounds grand stand, where a crowd of 15000 had gathered. The grandstand -- 10,000 capacity -- was filled. Fig Leaf got tired of waiting around and left me. Pretty soon the whole 4 of them came around and found me. I don't see how they did it in the crowd. 

Well, there was very little we could do or see at the exercises, but we just stalled around. On a clever pretext I rushed back to {{ "barracks" | lod_link: "Camp Crane" }} and got Fig Leaf to help me out. We had quite a good time till 5:00, when Grainger and Elmer Heald and a thunderstorm came, all together. 

Of course we couldn't get {{ "Central Park" | lod_link: "Central Park, Allentown" }} or any other picnic place in a thunder storm, so we walked down to Rhues, protecting the girls under our slickers, and ate our lunch on the parlor floor. What fun they poked at me for the cake escapade of the afternoon! 

Later in the evening we went over to {{ "Miss Dilcher" | lod_link: "" }}'s home, and from there to the movies. I was lucky in securing the queen of the bunch, a {{ "Miss Morris" | lod_link: "" }}, in the pairing off. 

We left the movies none too soon to reach the camp by 11,00, and I lingered on Morris's front porch long enough to devour an ice cream cone. When I left I had just time to get back. 

I started back and soon overtook another man from camp. At my suggestion we started up {{ "Chew Street" | lod_link: "Chew St., Allentown" }} at double. We passed a couple of other men in uniform, who seemed to be scared by our running. They fell in with us at the double time. The four of us at regular U.S. double time on hard pavement made a noise like the {{ "German Army" | lod_link: "" }} "straightening out an awkward salient in a victorious and completely successful retiring movement on the western front". The panic must have been contagious, for far ahead of us we heard another group break into double time. We passed a man talking to a girl in under a street lamp. "Look out pardner!" we called to him, and he joined us. A boy was sitting on a front porch. He called a hasty goodbye and ran down the stairs as we passed. Someone on one of the porches called out "Hurry up, boys!". 

Then a big Winton Six slowed up beside us. "Jump on boys!" called the driver. And the whole bunch, which now numbered a dozen, swarmed on the car and swept up to the gate in time, gave a cheer for the driver, and lined up in the long line that has to form at 11:00, when every man must submit his pass to close scrutiny as they pass, one by one, through the gate. 

When I got to my {{ "barracks" | lod_link: "Camp Crane" }} I found no blankets on my cot. All the clothes that hang above my head were gone. I didn't know what had happened. Then {{ "Red Aubry" | lod_link: "" }} woke up. "Well here's {{ "Binkley" | lod_link: "Robert C. Binkley" }} -- where you been, Binkley? This kind of dissipation has got to stop, Binkley!" Then Otto Lachmund and a lot of other fellows woke up and began to tease me. 

The blankets and clothes had been threatened by the thunderstorm and taken further into the barracks, to protect them. My bunk was soaking wet, but I pulled out my shelter but and used it for a bunk. That was all on Saturday night. 

Sunday morning I went to Sunday school and church. I went home with Dilcher's for dinner. Miss Dilcher is quite pretty, and the dinner was very good, but I was so worried about the speech I would have to make at the jail that I am afraid I didn't show up very well socially. After dinner I asked for pencil and paper and worked out my speech, trying to fix it up in such a way that it would hit home to the prisoners without taking the "I am holier than thou" attitude. 

{{ "Mr Dilcher" | lod_link: "" }} is a substantial banker of {{ "Catasaqua" | lod_link: "Catasaqua" }}, but a very pleasant man. He has a fine Paige car. I was very glad that Otto Lachmund happened to be running past just as Miss Dilcher and I were climbing into the Paige. 

When we got to the jail there was just a little difficulty about letting us in. Mrs. Ruhe had not come yet, and they didn't know whether we were morphine peddlers or not. But quite a crowd gathered and pretty soon they let us in. The jail is a very modern one, with three tiers of cells, above each other. But it is so arranged that from a little platform a court yard containing most of the cells can be seen. On this platform the whole bunch gathered and sang a lot of songs. The prisoners sang so loud they fairly drowned out our voices. We sang the songs the boys selected -- "*Where is my wondering boy tonight?*" "*Throw out the lifeline*". Some of the prisoners have wonderful voices. One of them in particular, who sang a solo, had been on the vaudeville stage till the police found out what a fine burglar he was.

My speech came off pretty well, I think, considering the situation. This is what I said. The peculiar form of the introduction was due to the fact that the guy who had made the prayer had balled things up by taking the regular hypocritical attitude of unimpeachable goodness and superiority. 

"We are not here because we think we are any better than anybody else. We are here because we have a friend whom we want others to know. We are here because there are some things that mean a great deal to us; and we hope that they will mean something to others also. 

"We boys here are going into something bigger than anything we ever tackled before. Most of us are cutting loose from homes that have meant everything to us in the past. We know that we are going to have to face some pretty big problems. We know that we are going to meet temptation such as we never knew at home. 

"I know that these hard times are coming, and I have made a plan that will make me a winner no matter what happens. It is a plan in which I have supreme confidence. And I believe that any man who sees before him the certainty of temptation will find in it a source of unconquerable strength. 

"I know that a time will come when my own will will be weak. Then I will strengthen myself by means of my friends. I will need help; this is how I will get it. 

I have a mother back in California who thinks the world of me. When I feel myself growing weak I think of that mother. And the thought of her will give me the power to be the kind of a man she thinks I am. 

"I have friends in California; friends whom I like, and who, I believe, like me. I will think of them, and be as true as they believe me to be. 

"I have a little sister at home, about as big as that -- she used to come running out the gate to meet me when I came home from school, with her little arms stretched out to me. And I would pick her up and carry her in on my shoulder. I will think of her, too, and be as big and as strong a brother as she thinks I am. 

"And there is another friend, too -- One whom I have known only for a short time. And though all else should fail this Friend will give me His strength wherever I call upon him. 

"If my mother should be taken away; if my friends should forget me, or cast me aside; if my little sister should grow up to womanhood and never know my face; -- if I should never return again to California, this Friend would stick to me and give me his aid. -- This friend is Jesus Christ. 

"And the wonderful thing about Christ is this. He is glad to be the Friend of any man. The world has always given me a square deal. But there are some men to whom the world has not given a square deal. And for them Christ will care as fondly as he cares for me, giving them strength to meet whatever may come to them. 

"I am only a boy -- I have seen but little of the world -- but old men who have lived full lives will tell you the same thing: -- that Jesus Christ is my Friend and your Friend, and that he will help whoever ask him. 

"These young men you see here are going out on a long journey. But we go with perfect confidence, knowing that Jesus Christ will be our *Friend* no matter what happens, we hope that all men who see before tham a long, hard journey will put their trust in the same good Friend, and receive the help that he so freely gives. 

--

You didn't know I was so orthodox, did you? Perhaps I was a little stereotyped in the thing, but I figured that it was the best I could do that would realy hep those men. After all the thing is to get *them* to think of the best things in thir own lives. I think it must have affected them a little. A few handkerchiefs came out -- blue polka dots, not white ones. And all the old men in our crowd were saying "Amen!" at a great rate. Of course the reason I played up the uniforms and youth was that we had been introduced as boys of the {{ "Ambulance Corps" | lod_link: "USAAS" }} and given a send off to the prisoners which made my references fit in pretty well. 

I went home with Dilchers and had supper. 

At League I met {{ "Harold Thompson" | lod_link: "" }} who said he knew {{ "Elizabeth" | lod_link: "Elizabeth M. Binkley" }}. Thompson told about the 900 men watching the polls in the city in 1916. 

At church a bunch of Hamlin boys sang several songs. They closed the service with the good old 

"Keep the home fires burning   
While the hearts are yearning   
Though your lads are far away   
They dream of home.   
There's a silver lining   
Through the dark clouds shining   
Turn the dark clouds inside out   
Till the boys come home." 

They sang it over twice; then the whole congregation joined in. I tell you that song has *meaning* here. 

After church Grainger found me waiting outside. He asked me if I was going to take home a girl. I told him yes, if the Choir master ever let them come out and my link stood by me. He asked me if I was going to take Miss Dilcher. "No," I said. For I had told a guy named {{ "Plank" | lod_link: "" }} to ask Miss Dilcher quickly, because I wanted Miss Morris. But the trouble was that Grainger also was waiting for Morris. 

"Let's flip for her!" I suggested. 

"No!" 

"Go on. The loser takes {{ "Miss Ruhe" | lod_link: "Leah Rhue" }} !" 

"Nothing doing. That {{ "Miss Ruhe" | lod_link: "Leah Rhue" }} is a mud fence. I wouldn't take her to a barber shop!" 

"Well then, if there's no combination it will have to be competition."

{{ "Miss Ruhe" | lod_link: "Leah Rhue" }} and Miss Morris came over together to where we were waiting. Morris was limping because the heel had come off her shoe. I nobly offered to fix it; took it outside, pounded it on the sidewalk and returned in glory, But two undetachable South Carolina men had joined us. Nevertheless I aked Miss Morris if I could go along if I was good. She assented, so South Carolina, Morris and I walked in second rank while Grainger, Miss Ruhe and South Carolina II acted as file leaders. We stayed around a little at Ruhe's. I got an opportunity to ask Morris if she had an excort; she said yes, she was sorry. I told her I was too, and Grainger and I walked off together, leaving the field to South Carolina. 

Final act, so far, was staged yesterday -- Tuesday. There was a social. Little slips were distributed and we got partners by matching slips. I matched mine with a {{ "Miss Ripple" | lod_link: "" }} who was jolly but not particularly class. Grainger wisely did not try to match, for Miss Morris had not come yet. Consequently when Morris came he was right ready while I was hopelessly tied up. I surrendered  without a murmur, and did not do anything more than be exceeding nice to Miss Morris when opportunity offered; and took home a lemon named {{ "Beets" | lod_link: "Beets" }} with her companion {{ "Traxor" | lod_link: "" }}. 

The next act in the drama will be staged tomorrow when Ruhe, Morris, Dilcher, & someone else will have a little party for Grainger, myself, and someone else or two, all of which will be faithfully recorded in next diary. 

I had my picture taken at {{ "Wirth Studio" | lod_link: "" }}, but I won't be able to get the prints for a good long time. 

I was sick yesterday, but feel fine now. I had constipation, belly achy, tooth ache, and typhoid injection all to wunst. No wonder! 

Adams and I played three games of chess tonight. I was licked each time. {{ "Rix Maurer" | lod_link: "" }} watched and tried to learn the game. He seemed realy interested. 

{{ "Otto" | lod_link: "Otto Lachmund" }} has been trying to fix nicknames to {{ "Adams" | lod_link: "William Adams" }} and me. I am to be "Fedora, the Bull Slinger," and {{ "Bill" | lod_link: "William Adams" }} is "Gwendolyn, $5. prize to anyone who sees her shave." We have lots of fun teasing and being teased. When we get started right Adams and I can hold up our end of the string. 

Mess is getting better now. They had some of the best beans I ever ate tonight. But the Karo syrup has gone and the old blackstrap molasses takes its place. Law of Compensation still works. 

The other night Bill and I went to the {{ "Orpheum" | lod_link: "Orpheum Theater" }} and witnessed a rotten show with some fake Hawaian dope that would never have gotten by in the west. We were both so sick (It was typhoid night) that we were careful to ride right by an open window on the way home. 

By the way (I am just jotting down everything I can thank of). They have a swell financial system at this church.  *Everybody* gives a nickel or dime at Church, Sunday School, League and Church. It is just like paying admission. If a man passes the plate without making a noise they look at him as if he were trying to cheat God. 

Our boys are going to try to get up a dance downtown for next Tuesday. I don't know whether I will go or not. If I could get Miss Morris I would take a chance, because she is realy class. 

Will answer letters as soon as I can.

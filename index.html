<p>This is a transcription of Robert C. Binkley's diary kept during July 1917 during his time in training for the USAAS at Cap Crane in Allentown, Pennsylvania. The diary was really an extended letter to his family, and was mailed home to California when it was full. Somehow it survived the destruction of most of his other wartime papers in the fire that destroyed the first house at the Binkley ranch in October, 1919.</p>

This is an attempt to use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Ed.](https://github.com/elotroalex/ed) to publish narratives enriched with Linked Open Data. It's the latest in a series of ongoing experiments documented in my [research notebook](https://timsherratt.org/research-notebook/projects/lodbooks/).

  content: "The letter James Minahan was waiting for had arrived at last. Sent from the firm of Quong Hing Yeong in Hong Kong, the letter contained the news that having received a remittance of HK$200 from Australia they could now book him a passage to Melbourne, the city of his birth. At 31 years old, James had decided to return to Australia after twenty-six years in China. He had spent the last decade studying for the imperial examinations (kējǔ) but after three unsuccessful attempts to gain a degree he had decided to try his luck in business in Australia instead.\n\nIn late 1907, James had written to his father’s former business partner, Chin Shing, asking him to send money for the passage. Over the many years since James and his now dead father had returned to China, Chin Shing had regularly sent them money from the business they jointly owned – a small store at Indigo in northeastern Victoria. Chin Shing would typically give the money to friends going down to Melbourne, who would then send it to Hong Kong though one of the Little Bourke Street stores, such as Hang Yick or, in this case, Sun Nam Hie &amp; Co. The receiving firm in Hong Kong would then send the money on to China, initially to James’s father Cheong Ming, or after Cheong Ming’s death in 1896, to James himself.\n\nOn hearing from Quong Hing Yeong that this latest remittance had arrived, James wrote back asking details of the next ship bound for Australia. The SS Taiyuan was due to sail from Hong Kong for Sydney on Wednesday, 1 January 1908, and James began to make preparations to leave the only home he really knew – the small village of Shek Quey Lee near Kongmoon, where he had lived since the age of five.\n\nJames’s journey from Kongmoon to Hong Kong was on a small steamer, and on his arrival he went to Quong Hing Yeong to book a passage on the Taiyuan. He presented his Victorian birth certificate as proof of his entitlement to land in Australia and paid HK$210 for the fare. Then he wrote to Chin Shing to expect his arrival.\n\nChin Shing was not surprised by James’s imminent return to Australia. He had received other letters over the past couple of years telling him of James’s failure at the imperial examinations and of his intention to come back to Victoria. As requested, he had sent James £21 for his passage (the HK$200 received by Quong Hing Yeong) via Melbourne merchants Chin Kay and Ah Doe of Sun Nam Hie &amp; Co. in Little Bourke Street. And now, on hearing that James was soon to arrive, he again contacted Chin Kay.\n\nChin Shing was busy in Indigo, with his business and family, and had not been to Melbourne in more than two decades, but Chin Kay was already in Melbourne and could more easily meet James on his arrival. Chin Kay knew James and his father, both in China and Australia. His home in Shek Quey Lee was just opposite from where James lived, and he had seen both father and son there on his various trips home over the previous 25 years. Receiving Chin Shing’s letter about a week before James’s arrival, Chin Kay made preparations to meet his boat when it got to Melbourne.\n\nAfter leaving a wintery Hong Kong, the Taiyuan made its way south. First… Then crossing the equator…\n\nWhen the Taiyuan sailed into Sydney Harbour on Thursday, 23 January 1908, there were 47 passengers on board. Thirty-nine of these were Chinese men – four bound for Sydney and six for Melbourne, with the remainder travelling on to New Zealand and Fiji. James Minahan was one of those bound for Melbourne, but his name, as such, does not appear on the passenger manifest. Instead, he is listed as James Kitchen, aged 31, storekeeper. His race is given as Chinese and, under the column for nationality, it is noted that he had a birth certificate, no. 23008.\n\nSydney Customs inspector JTT Donohoe was on the wharf to meet the Taiyuan and, after inspecting the passengers’ papers, he decided to give James the Dictation Test. James was unable to complete it, but as his ultimate destination was Melbourne not Sydney, he was allowed to continue on with his fellow passengers. James and the other five men were handprinted then transhipped to the SS Wollowra. They sailed again at 5.30pm on Friday, 24 January, for the final stage of their journey to Melbourne.\n\nAs they made their way south, Donohoe advised the Melbourne Collector of Customs and the Secretary of the Department of External Affairs of their coming, forwarding their handprints and documents, including birth certificate no. 23008, to assist Melbourne Customs with the men’s identification. After the Wollowra arrived at the Australian Wharf in Melbourne on Sunday, 26 January 1908, the six men were briefly seen by Customs officer Hugh Mercer. But, since it was a Sunday and Mercer had no Chinese interpreter with him, he decided to return the following day to formally examine them. Mercer returned on Monday and, with the help of government translator Harry Hoyling, interviewed James Minahan in the saloon of the Wollowra. Mercer also spoke to ‘a reputable Chinaman’, tobacco dealer Chan Num, who had known James as a boy and had come to meet him at the wharf. As planned, Chin Kay had also come to meet the boat.\n\nTo execute his duties, Mercer needed to establish whether the birth certificate James presented was really his own. He later noted that there was no indication on the certificate that it belonged to someone who was ‘Chinese’. The certificate was in the name ‘James Francis Kitchen’, no father’s name was given and the mother was one Winifred Minahan. How could it belong to a man who seemed so Chinese in appearance and manner, who understood not a word of the English being spoken to him? After interviewing James, Mercer was not convinced that he was who he claimed to be and applied the Dictation Test. Through the interpreter Harry Hoyling, Mercer told James that he was going to read a passage of not less than fifty words in English and that he was required to write them in English. He gave James a pencil and paper and read the passage once slowly. This was the passage he read:\n\n\n  A large part of the cheapening of steel has been brought about by this one device for using cheap inferior fuels. In the iron trade it was discovered many years ago that it paid to produce more of this particular gas than could be used in the purely metallurgical operations.\n\n\nWhen asked, James said that he couldn’t write out the passage. Mercer informed him that he was a prohibited immigrant and that he could not land in Australia. James was to be transferred back to the Taiyuan and returned to Hong Kong.\n\nThe next day, Tuesday, James left Melbourne for Sydney on the Wollowra, and Melbourne Customs informed their Sydney colleagues of his rejection under the Immigration Restriction Act. When he arrived in Sydney two days later, James was escorted by Customs inspector Donohoe back to the Taiyuan, which was due to sail for Hong Kong at the end of the following week. On Thursday, 6 February, however, two days before the scheduled departure, the Taiyuan’s Captain Dawson was asked to show cause why a writ of habeas corpus should not be issued against him for holding James Minahan on board.\n\nThe matter was heard before Mr Justice Street in chambers on Friday, 7 February. Captain Dawson argued that he was acting on the orders of the Commonwealth Customs department, who had declared James Minahan was a prohibited immigrant. Under section 9 of the Immigration Restriction Act, as master of the vessel he would be liable for a penalty of £100 if a prohibited immigrant land from his vessel. Justice Street, however, concluded that there had been no clear demonstration that James Minahan was in fact a prohibited immigrant under the Act, and his release was ordered.\n\nJames Minahan left the Taiyuan at around one o’clock that afternoon, but he was not free for long. Acting on instructions from the Department of External Affairs, Customs inspector Donohoe had waited at Circular Quay for James Minahan and arrested him as he left the wharf. Donohoe took him to the No. 4 Police Station at George Street North, where he was charged with being a ‘prohibited immigrant found within the Commonwealth in contravention of the Immigration Restriction Act, 1901–1905’. James Minahan was brought before the Water Police Court at two o’clock, and remanded in custody until the following Friday. He was held in Darlinghurst Gaol.\n\nOn 6 February, when Captain Dawson had been summonsed to appear before Justice Street, the Collector of Customs in Sydney had sent an urgent telegram to the Department of External Affairs in Melbourne for advice on what action to take. The Secretary, Atlee Hunt responded, also by telegram:\n\n\n  Take no action in Kitchens case … so far as habeas proceedings are concerned presume he will be brought before Court and his discharge ordered … if that happens he should be arrested on leaving Court and charged with being prohibited immigrant &amp; on appearance before police court remand should be applied for to allow Crown solicitor to be instructed\n\n\nAtlee Hunt also received a personal letter from James Minahan’s Melbourne solicitor, EA Fortescue Croft, sent from Sydney on 6 February. When James Minahan had been rejected at Melbourne and returned to Sydney, Croft had rushed north to start proceedings on his behalf. Croft told Hunt that he ‘would only be playing the game fair with you after all your past consideration to me’ if he let Hunt know the true state of things, and he asked Hunt to ‘take this private letter in the spirit in which it is sent’. He told Hunt that he had ‘taken your middle course here by issuing an order nisi calling on the captain to shew cause why a writ of habeas corpus should not issue’. Croft had been advised by the Commonwealth’s counsel in the case that this was ‘the Sydney practice’.\n\nThese private discussions between James Minahan’s solicitors and those representing the Commonwealth were the beginnings of a course of action, engineered behind the scenes, which saw James Minahan’s case transferred from Sydney to Melbourne. The Department of External Affairs passed the matter to the Crown Solicitor and, on request, Customs inspector Donohoe sent his file to the Crown Solicitor’s Sydney office – they had advised that ‘good Counsel’ should be nominated to prosecute the case. Moves were also taken for Melbourne Customs officer Hugh Mercer and Chinese translator Harry Hoyling to journey to Sydney for the hearing against James Minahan on Friday, 14 February. Realising the difficulty and expense of defending his client in Sydney, a city where he had no friends or contacts, on the day of James Minahan’s arrest Croft wrote to Atlee Hunt suggesting that the case be transferred to Melbourne. Atlee Hunt advised the Crown Solicitor that ‘the Department has no particular wish to act either for or against Mr Croft’s desires and will accept your decision which will doubtless be in accord with the general balance of convenience’. Croft and the Crown Solicitor soon came to an agreement which suited all parties.\n\nJames Minahan was released from Darlinghurst Gaol on bail on Tuesday, 11 February, with recognizance to appear at court that Friday to answer the charges against him. Instead, however, he left Sydney that night with his solicitor on the express train for Melbourne. He was arrested on arrival and, after being bailed, went to stay at Sun Nam Hie &amp; Co., the Little Bourke Street firm run by his uncles, Ah Doe and Ah Yuey. The Sydney charges were dropped, as had been agreed, and the case against James Minahan proceeded in the Court of Petty Sessions in Melbourne on Friday, 28 February 1908, one month after James Minahan’s initial arrest. It was another seven months after that until an appeal to the High Court resulted in a ruling, laid down on Thursday, 8 October 1908, that gave James Minahan the right to be in Australia and to remain in the country of his birth.\n\n",

  content: "\n  ‘A few Celestials . . . marry barbarian girls’ – Illustrated Australian News, 18681\n\n\nPeople of the West always imagined themselves to be very different from the Chinese. When the two groups encountered each other in the colonies of south-eastern Australia in the mid-nineteenth century, this idea of difference underpinned the white colonials first and subsequent impressions of those arriving from the ‘Celestial Empire’. Small numbers of Chinese men and boys had arrived in Victoria and New South Wales before the 1850s, but it was with the discovery of gold that immigration from China rapidly increased. Between YEAR and YEAR, NUMBER of Chinese men arrived in Victoria, and NUMBER in New South Wales. Only a very small number of Chinese women and girls made the journey, particularly in the early years. NUMBERS.\n\nThe Chinese were only one immigrant group among many. The colonies also became home to new arrivals from Italy, Germany AND SO ON, as well as the many thousands arriving from England, Scotland and Ireland, but the Chinese were the most visible minority and the one which seemed most foreign to white Australian colonists. Not only did the Chinese look different from those of British and European stock, but their language, customs and religion were unfamiliar and unsettling. It was easy for white Australians to make unfounded and often outlandish accusations about the Chinese, from allegations of widespread homosexual practices and a supposed preference for eating dogs and cats to mockery of their broken English and queues (pigtails) and complaints about their frugal lifestyle and lack of ‘family life’ in the colonies. All of this rendered the Chinese more foreign and the Chinese became well aware of quite how white colonials perceived them.\n\nQuite how the Chinese saw their new white neighbours and the landscape of their new home was much less obvious to the Australian eye. Some Chinese had come from the Californian goldfields and would have known something of the language and customs of the ‘foreign devils’. Others had encountered Westerners in the Chinese treaty ports or in Hong Kong, some were schooled in missionary schools and spoke English. For others, it was their first real encounter with the people they knew as ‘barbarians’ with red hair and big noses. SEE FRANK DIKOTTER BOOK. The landscape too was foreign – summers hot and dry and brown, not wet and green and humid…\n\nBy 1860 however, something else was happening in the colonies which demonstrated that for all the rhetoric of racial, cultural and biological difference, Chinese and white Australians were meeting and mixing in the most intimate of ways. Even with their apparent differences, increasing numbers of Chinese men and white Australian women were coming together, forming relationships, getting married and having babies. GO INTO SOME STATS AND INFO FROM EARLY REPORTS. By the time the colonial censuses began to enumerate those classified as ‘half-caste Chinese’ in the later part of the nineteenth century, the numbers had grown much larger. The Victorian census of 1871 (the first to record ‘half-caste Chinese’ separately) found that there were NUMBER in the colony; in 1881, SOMETHING ABOUT THE TWO FOLLOWING CENSUSES IN VIC AND NSW. By the turn of the new century, the numbers of ‘half-caste Chinese’ were reported as being NUMBER in Victoria and NUMBER in New South Wales, almost equally divided between men and women. These figures did not, of course, include those who might have chosen to hide their part-Chinese ancestry, or those who identified purely as Chinese.\n\nThese interracial relationships, and the mixed race progeny they produced, were not met with enthusiasm by many white commentators. DISCUSSION OF RHETORICAL STUFF – pollution of race etc. The response to mixed relationships shown within different parts of the Australian community was complex and contradictory though, ranging from the most vehement of hatred and violence by some, to acceptance and even encouragement by others. On a general level, there was a measure of toleration. Unlike parts of the United States which had anti-miscegenation laws, no legislation was introduced in the Australian colonies that forbid marriages between Chinese and whites, nor were there specific laws such as the NAME OF LAW in Canada which prevented white women from being employed by Chinese. The children of marriages between Chinese and whites were legitimate, and mixed race families were not subjected to particular interference by authorities. In many ways, it seems that colonial communities adopted the attitude expressed by NAME in his NAME OF WORK in DATE:\n\nQuote the bit about general and particular.\n\nWhite women, their Chinese partners and their mixed race children lived in many communities, small and large, in both rural and urban parts of Victoria and New South Wales. They worked, ran businesses, raised families, were education, attended church – they did all the things that other people did. RICH, POOR, ETC. DATA FROM MY MARRIAGE RECORDS.\n\nBut even as these families got on with living their often very ordinary lives, there were continuing concerns at a political level about the Chinese presence, the so-called ‘Chinese Question’, and interracial relationships continued to be a part of these concerns. 1861 DEBATES, 1888 DEBATES, 1901 DEBATES = WHITE AUSTRALIA. IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION ACT. These debates centred around what happened when the Chinese were allowed in, and focused on keeping the Chinese out. But by the turn of the twentieth century there were already lots here, settled, Australian-born, living Australian lives.\n\nThis book tells the story of one young Anglo-Chinese man whose life became entangled in the mechanisms of White Australia and the fears and suspicions that Australian nation had towards the Chinese foreigner. If his father had not decided to take him to China as a boy, James Minahan may well have gone on to live one of those more-or-less ordinary lives of other Anglo-Chinese born in the colonies. He may well have been among the ancestors of Australians today who can trace their family connections back to a Chinese great-great-grandfather etc. DISCUSSION OF FAMILY HISTORY RENAISSANCE. But James Minahan’s life didn’t follow that path, and the legal case that ensued provides us with a rare insight into how White Australia, that is, how the men who dealt with the law and policy of White Australia, thought about Australians of mixed race and how the system dealt with them.\n\nThe story is mostly revealed through a file of the Department of External Affairs and a file of the High Court. Alongside the bigger picture about White Australia is the detailed and intimate facts of a family’s breakdown, of a child’s loss of his mother, of a Chinese community where there was a different kind of family life, bound by clan and kinship and native place.\n",
